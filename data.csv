This resulted in those affected (and refunded!) items being ultimately delivered to the customers.

We found out that this cancellation was caused by an automatic cancellation logic inside `logistic_order` service. 

As a result, we improved some of our internal state handling (especially how we handle `logistic_order.dispatched`). This fix better handles cancelling of such order items, and thus ultimately also prevents triggering the unwanted refund. 

@Flo nicely covers the technicalities here:

Adding an extract directly from the original ticket - as hints:

”The original boilerplate had size: 80mm $$height$$ but this gives us the long blank space. After research I dont think this is a valid CSS code value. It is ignored and I assume the CSS default to auto for the height. As per Order LS000003671 (below). I replaced the items from being listed and you can see as per order LS000003672 where it improved the legth of the blank space after the footer but there is still some. What points to the blanks space being related to the CSS and height is when we set the CSS to width:80mm; alone. The result is no space below the footer, how it should be and you can see it’s defaulted to fixed pages and we get the double lines after 2 items, 9 items and for the final item and footer.

Hoping we can be given with a suggestion on how we should define the CSS. I am sure Leays is not the only customer using Newstore and the ribbon paper approach to printing receipts. How have other customers succeeded in this area we are having an issue?”

Adding snap from the conversation with ES. The confirmed similar.

Upon reviewing historical context around the Route To Specific Location feature, I found that the exception handler was originally intended as an override mechanism. It allows routing to proceed despite delivery failures or insufficient stock, essentially ignoring such validation errors.

Given this, It might be good to revisit this functionality. In particular, we should consider whether:

* Failures could be made visible to the user (rather than silently ignored), and/or
* The exception handler process could be safely re-triggered if needed.
